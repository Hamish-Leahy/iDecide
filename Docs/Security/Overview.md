# iDecide: High-Level Security Architecture

## Introduction
iDecide is an iOS application designed to help users plan their legacy, manage important documents, and organize their personal affairs. Given the sensitive nature of the information handled by the app, security is a top priority in its architecture.

## Core Security Principles
1. Data Protection
2. User Authentication
3. Secure Storage
4. Privacy-First Design

## Security Features

### 1. User Authentication
- Email and password-based authentication
- Optional Face ID integration for enhanced security
- Secure password storage using hashing (implementation details needed)

### 2. Data Encryption
- Core Data is used for local data storage
- FileProvider framework for document storage (implementation details needed)
- Encryption at rest for all sensitive data (implementation details needed)

### 3. Access Control
- User-specific data isolation
- Family member access controls with granular permissions

### 4. Secure Communication
- HTTPS for all network communications (implementation details needed)
- Certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (if implemented)

### 5. Local Data Protection
- App utilizes iOS data protection APIs
- Data is encrypted when the device is locked

### 6. Secure State Management
- SwiftUI's @State and @Binding for secure state management
- Proper clearing of sensitive data from memory when not in use

### 7. Document Security
- Secure document upload and storage
- Access controls for shared documents

### 8. Audit Logging
- Logging of critical operations and access attempts (implementation details needed)

### 9. Third-Party Dependencies
- Minimal use of third-party libraries to reduce attack surface
- Regular updates of dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities

### 10. Compliance
- Designed with GDPR and CCPA compliance in mind
- User data export and deletion capabilities

## Security in the Development Process
- Code reviews with a focus on security
- Regular security testing and audits
- Secure coding practices enforced across the development team

## Incident Response
- Clear procedures for handling potential security breaches
- Prompt notification to affected users in case of a data breach

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of multi-factor authentication
- Regular security penetration testing
- Enhanced encryption for document storage

## Conclusion
The security architecture of iDecide is designed to protect sensitive user information at every level, from data storage to user interaction. We are committed to continuously improving our security measures to ensure the highest level of protection for our users' data.
